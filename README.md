# House Rocket

### The Challenge

House Rocket is a digital platform whose business model is the purchase and sale of properties using technology.

You are a Data Scientist contracted by the company to help you find the best business opportunities in the real estate market.
House Rocket's CEO would like to maximize the company's revenue by finding good business opportunities.

Its main strategy is to buy good houses in great locations with low prices and then resell them later at higher prices. 
The greater the difference between buying and selling, the greater the company's profit and therefore the greater its revenue.
However, houses have many attributes that make them more or less attractive to buyers and sellers, and the location and time of year can also influence prices.

Therefore, your job as a Data Scientist is to answer the following questions:

- 1. **Which houses should the House Rocket CEO buy and at what purchase price?**

- 2. **Once the house is owned by the company, what is the best time to sell it and what would be the price of the sale?**

- 3. **Should House Rocket do a renovation to increase the sale price? What would be the suggestions for changes? What is the increase in the price given for each retirement option?**
